                    <h2>7. Procedure for Reporting Security Incident</h2>
                    <p>Security incidents as well as events and weaknesses of the data processing system need to be
                        reported at the earliest possible stage as they need to be assessed by the Data Protection
                        Officer and the Head of the SIRT. The Data Protection Officer enables the Security Incident
                        Response Team (SIRT) to identify when a series of events or weaknesses have escalated to become
                        an incident. The SIRT needs to gain as much information as possible from the data subjects or
                        personnel to identify if an incident is occurring.</p>
                    <p>Examples of the security events, weaknesses, and common forms of Security Incidents have been
                        provided below:</p>
                    <h3>Security events can include:</h3>

                        <li>Access violations – e.g. password sharing.</li>
                        <li>Breaches of physical security.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Loss of ID badge/s.</li>

                    <h2>10. Data Breach Notification of the NPC and Data Subjects</h2>
                    <p>The DPO shall assess and recommend whether the Personal Data Breach should be reported to the
                        National Privacy Commission (NPC) as required under the Data Privacy Act of 2012.</p>
                    <p>The following shall be reported to NPC:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The personal data involves sensitive personal information or any other information that may
                            be used to enable identity fraud.</li>
                        <li>Other information includes, but is not limited to, the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Data about the financial or economic situation of the data subject.</li>
                                <li>Usernames, passwords, and other login data.</li>
                                <li>Biometric data.</li>
                                <li>Copies of identification documents, licenses, or unique identifiers like Philhealth,
                                    SSS, GSIS, TIN number.</li>
                                <li>Other similar information, which may be made the basis of decisions concerning the
                                    data subject, including the grant of rights or benefits.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>There is reason to believe that the information may have been acquired by an unauthorized
                            person.</li>
                        <li>The personal information controller believes that the data breach is likely to give rise to
                            a real risk of serious harm to the affected data subject.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When there is doubt as to whether notification is necessary, consider factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The likelihood of harm or negative consequences on the affected data subjects.</li>
                        <li>How notification, particularly of the data subjects, could reduce the risks arising from the
                            personal data breach reasonably believed to have occurred.</li>
                        <li>If the data involves:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Information that would likely affect national security, public safety, public order,
                                    or public health.</li>
                                <li>At least one hundred (100) individuals.</li>
                                <li>Information required by all applicable laws or rules to be confidential.</li>
                                <li>Personal data of vulnerable groups.</li>
                            </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Aside from notifying the NPC, the University, through the DPO, SIRT, and University President,
                        shall also notify the affected Data Subjects within seventy-two (72) hours upon knowledge of or
                        the reasonable belief by the University that a Personal Data Breach has occurred.</p>
                    <p>Generally, there shall be no delay in notification, except to the extent necessary to determine
                        the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The scope of the breach.</li>
                        <li>To prevent further disclosures.</li>
                        <li>To restore reasonable integrity to the information and communications system.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Delay is not allowed if the breach involves at least one hundred (100) data subjects, or the
                        disclosure of sensitive, personal information will harm or adversely affect the data subject
                        except when the University is granted additional time by the NPC to comply.</p>
